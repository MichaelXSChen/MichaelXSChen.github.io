I am a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Dr. Heming Cui](http://www.cs.hku.hk/~heming). My research focuses distributed consensus protocols, fault tolerance systems, distributed transaction processing systems, and blockchain systems.

My research interests also include building highly-efficient distributed systems leveraging datacenter networking hardware (e.g., RDMA) and building secure distributed systems leveraging hardware trusted execution environments (e.g., Intel SGX).

Before my current program, I received Bachelor of Engineering degree from the University of Hong Kong with first class honour. I also enjoyed a wonderful half-year exchange program at UCSD during my undergraduate study.

I am from [Shenyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang), a beautiful city in northeast China.
