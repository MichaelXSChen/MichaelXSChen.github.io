**WIP, personal draft**

Recently I am reading papers about asynchronous consensus protocols, and I was 
try to compare these Protocols' designs with Paxos and PBFT. When re-reading Paxos
paper, some of the design points take me some time to think about its reasoning. 
These thoughts may be naive for Paxos experts, but I will just jot them down. 

in Paxos, a value is confirmed only if it is accepted *with the same ballot* by a majority
of acceptors. Why is having majority acceptors accept the same value not enough?

(At first, I thought the *accept* in Paxos is corresponding to *decide* in Ben-Or's algorithm, and thus
I was wondering why Ben-Or's algorithm can let nodes decide a value *in different rounds*, 
but Paxos requires majority nodes to *accept with the same ballot*. However, this 
comparison is wrong. Ben-Or's *decide* is more like the behavior of learners in 
Paxos, and Ben-Or's algorithm can be regarded as skipping the first phase of Paxos if 
we have to parallelize them.
)

To answer this question, we can simply construct a counter example to show that, after a majority
of acceptors have accepted a same value $$v$$ with different ballots, the system may decide 
a different value $$v'$$. I will use $$(n, v)$$ to denote a proposal of value $$v$$ with ballot $$n$$.

Let's use the simplest setting with 3 acceptors $$A_1, A_2, A_3$$, where $$A_1$$ accepted $$(n_1, v)$$
and $$A_2$$ accepted $$(n_2, v)$$. Without losing generality, let $$n_1 < n_2$$. Now we want one of 
them to switch to accept another value $$(n', v')$$ (after which another proposer can let the system accept
$$v'$$ by forming a majority with $$A_3$$). For simplicity, we assume there are no other concurrent 
proposals. 

If the prepare message of $n'$ arrived after $$A_1$$ and $$A_2$$ accepted $$v$$, its proposer will learn
and propose $$v$$, so at least one of them must prepare $$n'$$ before accepting $$v$$. On the other hand,
$$n'$$ cannot be smaller than both $$n_1$$ and $$n_2$$, otherwise they will ignore the accept message for 
$$v'$$, so we have $$n_1 < n' < n_2$$. 

We have the construction below. A new proposer can use $$A_1, A_3$$ to form a majority, and let the system 
accept $$v_2$$ at the end, even if two acceptors have accepted $$v_1$$ with different ballots.

Overall, in Paxos, although an acceptor will try let subsequent proposer to follow
its accepted value, the proposer can find a majority/quorum without including this acceptor.
Even if a majority of acceptors accept the same value $$v$$, if they are not of the same ballot, another 
proposer can still succeed in letting a majority of acceptors preparing a ballot that lies 
in the gap among the accepted ballots for $$v$$ before they all accept $$v$$. 

This makes me think another possible design. *What if we can have a method 
that can make there is no gap between the ballots for accepting the same value?* I did
not have a formal proof, but it seems to be enough for correctness. However, how can 
we ensure there are no new ballots can be inserted? Using consecutive integers? Using  
timestamps + safe timestamp mechanism? 

Another thought is about the proposed value. In Ben-Or's algorithm, a node tries to follow the value from other nodes in its Phase-1
in order to facilitate convergence. In contrast, in Phase-1 of Paxos, the
proposer does not follow the value prepared by acceptors; its proposed 
value is affected only by accepted values. 

What if we adapt Paxos and let a proposer to follow the value observed in Phase-1. I was 
thinking this may make it possible for enabling Paxos to confirm a value by accepting it value with different ballot.
However, by simple variants of the previous construction, we can see that it is not correct. However, will this 
adaption cannot make the consecutive-ballot design viable?

Anyway, these are just some random thinkings and I did not spend much time to verify them, as 
the vanilla Paxos (Paxos-made-simple) is rarely used in deployments.
